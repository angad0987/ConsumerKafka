#ConsumerKafka
ConsumerKafka is a repository that demonstrates the implementation of a Kafka consumer using Java Spring Boot. This project showcases how to set up and use Apache Kafka for consuming messages from a Kafka topic.

Key Features
Kafka Consumer Implementation: Provides a sample implementation of a Kafka consumer using the Spring Boot framework.
Message Consumption: Demonstrates how to consume messages from a Kafka topic and process them within a Spring Boot application.
Configuration: Includes configuration settings for Kafka brokers and consumer properties.
Server Code
The server code is written in Java using the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development of production-ready applications. The code includes:

Kafka Configuration: Configuration for connecting to Kafka brokers and subscribing to topics.
Message Processing: Logic for handling and processing messages consumed from Kafka topics.
Spring Boot Setup: Application setup and dependencies for running the Kafka consumer as a Spring Boot service.
